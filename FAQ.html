<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>Fighting Fake News is providing extensive coverage and information about fake news and answering common questions</p>

<h2>How is this different from “fake news”?</h2>

<p>This work explores both false and true information and their spread. According to a recent Gallup Poll, Americans refer to three distinct meanings when using the phrase “fake news”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>False news presented as truth</li>
  <li>Opinion presented as fact</li>
  <li>True news that cast a politician or political party in a negative light</li>
</ul>

<p>Our study was focused on contested news which often ends up being addressed by fact-checking organizations, and corresponds to (1) and (2) but not type (3) of “fake news.”</p>


<h3>How do you determine which sites contain real news and which are false?</h3>

<p>The stories contained in the sites have already been investigated by some or all of the six independent fact-checking organizations. The veracity of these stories are confirmed and extracted from the organizations’ websites and used as ground truth in our analysis.</p>
